Directions: This program can be used to "autosave" any game server that runs from a command line and has CLI save commands. 
"Autosave Path" is used to determine the path at which the file will save to and "Auto Backup Path" is the location that the backup will save to. 
The backup will create a new file entirely every X minutes that you specify rather than overwriting the save file like the typical "Autosave," the top text field, will do. 
Path Edit" locks down the filepaths in the program to allow or disallow you to edit the location once the program has started.
